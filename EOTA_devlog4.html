    <p>Sorry I haven't been updating this because of school, but i have done many work on the game.<br>I have made the lighting work, and I have a new mechanic, Deathattack!<br>Deathattack is an attack that can be done when the player has depleted half of an enemy's HP. It oneshots the current enemies I have now, but that won't be the case for some enemies, especially bosses.<br>The game has undergone many changes that I can't talk about, so this is the link to the repository.<a href="https://github.com/qkuldo/Echo-Of-The-Angels">Repository</a>. That's all!<br>-&lt;/qkuldo&gt;</p>
